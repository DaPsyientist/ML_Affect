# Machine Learning and affective experience
This is the github repo for our observational study investigating the alignment of subjective reports and objective measures regarding the intensity of emotional experiences. The manuscript is currently under review at Affective Science.

This repository contains the software engineering code necessary for our data preprocessing and temporal alignment pipeline as well as the analysis code required to replicate all the machine learning results and plots in the main body and supplemental materials.

Due to the sensitive nature of the data, as well as our responsibility to protect patient privacy, the dataset cannot be shared openly. However, data access requests can be made to M.K.N. (nock@wjh.harvard.edu) and will be considered on a case-by case basis.

If you have any questions about the code please contact Juan Castillo (jcastillo@g.harvard.edu).
